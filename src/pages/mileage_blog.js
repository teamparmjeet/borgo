Employers can provide reimbursement for allowable motoring expenses through flat-rate mileage allowances. However, it's crucial to note that you cannot claim mileage for your daily commute between your home and regular workplace; only business-related journeys away from your usual place of work are eligible.

                        Subsistence comes into play when you perform your job duties temporarily away from your usual workplace or while working abroad on an international assignment. These allowable subsistence expenses can be reimbursed to you tax-free. It's essential to emphasize that time spent at your regular workplace or during your commute doesn't count as a qualifying absence.

                        Typically, there are two ways to receive reimbursement for your expenses:
                        <br />
                        Receipt Submission: You can present your employer with expense receipts (e.g., hotel bills), and they will reimburse you for these documented costs.
                        <br />
                        Kilometre and Hours/Nights Tracking: Alternatively, you can keep track of the kilometres travelled and hours or nights spent away. If your employer is satisfied with your documentation, they will reimburse you according to the appropriate mileage and subsistence rates.

                        Sole traders themselves cannot claim mileage and subsistence, but their employees can. Instead, sole traders can claim actual expenses incurred during business trips and should maintain receipts for motor expenses, accommodations, and other travel-related costs. When preparing income tax returns, it might be necessary to allocate a portion of motor expenses to represent private expenditure.
