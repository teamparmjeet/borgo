                                    Countries outside of the European Economic Area <b>(EEA)</b> do not always offer the same levels of
                                    protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the
                                    EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.
                                    <br></br>
                                    Some of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area <b>(EEA)</b> so
                                    their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
                                    <br></br>
                                    Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of
                                    security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an
                                            adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or
                                            certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the
                                            same protection it has in Europe; or
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part
                                            of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data
                                            shared between the Europe and the US.
                                        </li>

                                    If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer.
                                    You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.

                                    disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
                                    other third parties who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal

                                    We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
                                    including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

                                    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
                                    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
                                    personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
                                    purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

                                    By law we have to keep data for six years after the conclusion of any engagement in order to comply our
                                    regulatory and tax obligations. In order to be in a position to establish, exercise and defend our legal
                                    rights, the firm has a policy of retaining all documentation in relation to engagements for seven years and
                                    half years from the date that the documentation was first received or created by the firm, or the
                                    completion date of the agreed service for which we have been engaged.

                                    You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
                                    However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.

                                    We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a
                                    month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
                                    notify you and keep you updated.
