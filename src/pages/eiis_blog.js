                    <ol>

<li>
    <b><u>50% Relief for Businesses Without Prior Market Operation</u> :</b> Companies that have not previously operated in any market will qualify for a 50% EIIS relief. This high rate serves as an incentive for investors to support innovative ventures that are launching into uncharted territory.
    </li>
                        <li><b><u>35% Relief for First-Time EIIS Fundraisers</u> :</b> Businesses entering their initial EIIS fundraise within 7 years of their first sale will be eligible for a 35% relief. This level of relief acknowledges the early-stage nature of these enterprises and helps attract investment during their crucial growth phase.
                        </li>
                        <li><b><u>20% Relief for Subsequent EIIS Fundraisers</u> :</b> For businesses embarking on their second or subsequent EIIS fundraise, the relief drops to 20%. This rate reflects the fact that these companies have already received a level of support through previous funding rounds.
                        </li>
                        <li><b><u>20% Relief for Businesses Expanding into New Markets</u> :</b> Under the updated scheme, businesses venturing into new markets or regions will also qualify for a 20% EIIS relief. This incentivizes entrepreneurs to explore untapped opportunities and diversify their operations.
                        </li>
                        <li><b><u>30% Relief for Investments via a Qualifying Investment Fund</u> :</b> Investments made through a 'Qualifying Investment Fund,' the only one currently available in Ireland, will attract a 30% EIIS relief. This avenue offers a higher rate than subsequent fundraises while ensuring investments are channeled through authorized channels.
                        </li>

Steve Schwarzman, the founder and chairman of Blackstone, a leading investment firm, recently emphasized the need to incentivize risk capital. He argued that in a low-growth economy, where securing significant returns with minimal loss is challenging, tax incentives play a vital role in motivating investors.</Typography>

As the scheme evolves, striking a balance between incentivizing investment and mitigating risks will be crucial to maintaining a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem in Ireland.
