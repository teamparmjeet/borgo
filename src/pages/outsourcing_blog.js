            For many small to medium-sized enterprises with growth-oriented

            In such cases, hiring a bookkeeper appears as a viable option.

            However, relying solely on bookkeeping services, which might cover
            specific functions like accounts receivable or accounts payable,
            offers only a partial solution, and often causes delays to the
            preparation of the increasingly important management accounts.

            When entrusting bookkeepers with reporting, the responsibility of
            acting as the internal accounting function falls within your
            company.
            <br />
            This includes evaluating the bookkeeper's work, ensuring procedural
            correctness, and addressing issues as they arise. This setup lacks
            efficiency and reliability, and as such, the number of companies
            that are turning to an outsourced accountant is growing
            month-on-month.

            Borgo are equipped to manage the entire accounting function, ensures
            the seamless operation of bookkeeping processes and financial
            reporting as it is required.
            <br />
            In this instance, Borgo assumes the role of their book-keeper
            manager, evaluating the accuracy of bookkeeping, identifying gaps,
            and rectifying discrepancies.
            <br />
            This oversight is critical in validating the precision and
            timeliness of bookkeeping records, akin to the practices observed in
            larger companies with dedicated internal accounting departments.
