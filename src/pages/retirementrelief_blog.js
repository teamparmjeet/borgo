                        Retirement relief is a valuable provision offered by the Irish Revenue to recognize the significance of a person's business as their life's work and often their retirement plan. In normal circumstances, selling a large business asset would trigger a capital gains tax (CGT) liability of 33%. However, retirement relief allows for an exemption on the amount of CGT payable upon the sale of a business.

If the disponer is between the ages of 55 and 65, the first €750,000 of the sale proceeds is exempt from CGT. For those aged 66 and over, the exemption is on the first €500,000. This means that if, for instance, you sell your company for €750,000 at the age of 62, you will not be liable to pay any CGT.
